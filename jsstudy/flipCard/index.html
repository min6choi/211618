                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>The Númenóreans moved against Sauron. They were so powerful that 
                            Sauron perceived that he could not defeat them by force. He surrendered 
                            himself to be taken as a prisoner to Númenor. There he quickly enthralled 
                            the king, Ar-Pharazôn, urging him to seek the immortality that the Valar 
                            had apparently denied him, fanning the envy that many of the Númenóreans 
                            had begun to hold against the Elves of the West and the Valar. The people 
                            of Númenor strove to avoid death, but this only weakened them and sped 
                            the gradual diminishing of their lifespans. Sauron urged them to wage war 
                            against the Valar to seize the immortality denied them. Ar-Pharazôn raised 
                            the mightiest army and fleet Númenor had ever seen, and sailed against Aman.</p>
